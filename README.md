# My React and Tailwind Project

This is a React project built using Vite and styled with Tailwind CSS. Follow the instructions below to clone the repository and run the project on your local machine.

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed on your machine:

- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (v6 or higher)

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository:**

   
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git

2. **Navigate to the project directory:**

     cd your-repo-name

3.Install dependencies:
  npm install
  
4.Run the project:
  npm run dev



This will start the Vite development server. You should see output indicating that the server is running and a local URL (usually http://localhost:3000) where you can view your project.


Building for Production

To build the project for production, run:

npm run build

   This will create an optimized production build in the dist folder.

Running the Production Build

To preview the production build locally, you can use a simple static file server. For example, you can use serve:

Install serve globally if you haven't already:

npm install -g serve

Run the production build:

serve -s dist

This will start a server and provide a URL (usually http://localhost:5000) where you can preview your production build.
